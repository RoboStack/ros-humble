requirements:
  # NOTE:
  # The idea with automatically adding versions to run_exports doesn't
  # work since we don't want all these dependencies as run deps of all ROS
  # packages. Therefore I am currently manually adding them to run_constrained.
  # This has to be synchronized with our current conda_build_config all the time :(
  # host:
  #   # values here should 
  #   - boost-cpp
  #   - log4cxx
  #   - poco
  #   - pcl
  #   - opencv
  #   - gazebo
  #   - ogre
  #   - qt
  # run:
  # values here should be applied from run_exports!
  # if the upstream package does not have run_exports
  # please change it in the conda_build_config.yaml!
